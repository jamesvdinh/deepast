dataset_config:

  # criteria set by min_bbox_percent and min_labeled_ratio. the z, y, x starting positions of these are saved to a json so we only
  # have to compute this once. on large volumes, this can take a long time.
  # ref label:
      # used for the valid patch finding. the name of these refers to the volume within volume paths. in the below example
      # "ink" is referring to the ink volume, defined one line above. you can provide any number of volume paths.
