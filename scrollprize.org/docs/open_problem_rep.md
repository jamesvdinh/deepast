### Representation
___
Representation is best thought of in the context of this Challenge as an idealized version of some scroll feature. A "perfect" representation of a scroll might be a well space archimedan spiral  

To create a readable 2d flattened papyrus sheet from a scroll volume, we have to first map our 3d surface to 2d space. To do this, we need to know _which points_ to map to 2d space, and in _what order_. The process is known as parameterization. Our goal in the representation step is to simplify these two questions.
