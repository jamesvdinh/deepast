We’re extremely curious about everyone’s progress, and want to be optimally prepared for reviewing the Grand Prize. That’s why we’re awarding a tiny prize:

**5x \$200 Private Progress Pics Prize** for the best *confidential* submissions of ink detection pictures from the inside of the scrolls, by Friday Dec 15th 11:59pm PT. This is completely confidential: we will not share your submission with anyone, and prize winners are not announced publicly.

If you’re working on the Grand Prize and have some promising early results, take 10 minutes out of your day to select the best pictures that you’ve produced so far, and send them to <a href="mailto:progresspics@scrollprize.org">progresspics@scrollprize.org</a>. Include a brief explanation of your method, and relevant context of the pictures (e.g. which scroll / segment). Don’t spend too much time on this — we want you to stay focused on the Grand Prize! Only 2.5 weeks left!!

Good luck everyone!
